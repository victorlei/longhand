1. Every connected curve is a potential glyph.

Over time, some of them will be split and some
joined (hebrew aleph,hei, latin K,A, numeric 4
and 5).  A bounding box is computed for each
potential glyph.

Each potential glyph is fitted a spline.

The splines are resampled, and their first
derivativd computed.

Using the derivatives we compute the distance
between each pair of potential glyphs. Spearmans r
is used as the distance measure.  Glyphs that
are found to represent the same leter are 
replaced with their averages.  Bounding boxes
are used to align and rescale the text.

2. Further analysis requires a vocabulary.

A predefined vocabulary is used to map the glyphs to
characters, and to join simple cases.

2. Word analysis

Using a sample text, we collect word prefixes, then
we match the first letter against the long glyphs.
